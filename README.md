## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introducing Myself

Hello, I'm Rich, a data analyst with a background in software engineering and product management. 

This portolio page is where I track my personal development and showcase what I've been working on.

### üå± Portfolio Projects

#### [Social Network Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/richhuwtaylor/fighting-churn)

A project demonstrating techniques for understanding and predicting customer churn for a simulated social network. By combining product usage analytics event data with customer subscription data, we can reveal which usage behaviours have the biggest impact on churn probability and predict the churn probability of individual accounts.

#### [AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Dashboard](https://github.com/richhuwtaylor/adventure-works)

A Microsoft Power BI business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. The data was derived from the [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) available from Microsoft.

#### [Dessert or Not? - A PySpark Logistic Regression Pipeline](https://github.com/richhuwtaylor/dessert-or-not)

A data cleaning and logistic regression pipeline implemented in PySpark which examines which aspects of an Epicurious recipe are important in determining whether or not the recipe is for a dessert. The final `pyspark.ml` Pipeline uses custom-made Transformers and Estimators for missing value imputation and outlier capping.
